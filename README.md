This uses arduino and processing along with the LM9DS1 9dof to find the earth's orientation in respect to the rocket. It uses Processing, a java based environment, to render the rocket. First, downlad the .ino file onto the arduino. Then run the Processing code with the arduino still connected to the computer. It will prompt you to type in the com port number, just the number. For example if the arduino was on COM19, I would just type 19 and hit enter. When the arduino connects, you need to spin the imu around as much as you can so it can calibrate the magnometer. After that, it should keep track of magnetic north and the rocket's orientation to gravity.
